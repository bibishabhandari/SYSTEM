$ ls -l #shows the file or directory under its present working directory with more information
$ ls -l f1.txt  #shows the f1.txt file with more info
$ ls -l -t  #shows the latest file first 
$ ls -l -t -r or $ ls -ltr #shows latest file in reverse order 
$ ls -l -s -i or $ ls -l -s --inode #i or inode = information node (inode) which is unique for each file
$ date #view the date and time
$ touch file.txt #creates a txt file
